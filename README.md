# JavaScript Null Handling Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to handling null or undefined values when performing arithmetic operations. The `bug.js` file contains a function that attempts to add two numbers, but fails to correctly handle cases where one or both inputs are null.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that addresses this issue.  This is a crucial aspect of defensive programming to avoid unexpected behavior and runtime errors.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and examine the code.
3. Run the code using Node.js. Observe the unexpected result when null values are passed.
4. Open `bugSolution.js` to see a better implementation.
